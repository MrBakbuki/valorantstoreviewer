Welcome to the VALORANT Store Viewer Privacy Policy.

I have programmed this app to not collect any type of user data. The app saves information on the user device ONLY. No information is sent to the app's servers.
The data is used by the app locally to access endpoints to retrieve information the user requests, which is the whole purpose of this app.
This data can be deleted by simply uninstalling the app, or clearing its data in the system settings.

If you find anything that might not suit the writted above, or a security vulnerability please email me: mrbakbuki@gmail.com (you can also DM me on Discord; Mr. Bakbuki#7076)
