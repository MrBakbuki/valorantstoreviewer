Welcome to VALORANT Store Viewer's Privacy Policy.

This app runs 100% locally, there is no backend. You can expect network requests sent to Riot Games, and valorantapi.com (to retrieve assets).
I have programmed this app to not collect any type of user data. The app saves information on the user's device only, not on any server whatsoever.
The data is used by the app locally to access endpoints to retrieve information the user requests, which is the whole purpose of this app.
This data can be deleted by simply uninstalling the app, or clearing its data in the system settings.

If you find anything that might not suit the written above, or a security vulnerability please email me: mrbakbuki@gmail.com (you can also DM me on Discord; mrbakbuki)
